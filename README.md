This is another practice that I initiated by creating a simple math and implemented FastAPI. So, what I learned from FastAPI is that this framework is for building APIs with python. This code creates a web API faster with minimal coding. It automatically handles HTTP requests, JSON parsing, validation, and error response. It relies on Pydantic for clean, structured input for validation.

### Example Output:

It performs a simple math:

A- Add function: 1 + 2 = 3

B- Substract function: 3 - 2 = 1

C- Multiply function: 5 * 3 = 15

D- Divide function: 15 / 10 = 1.5

##Disclaimer

I am learning, experimenting, and practicing with coding. I am exploring different tools, techniques, and programming languages to enhance my skills. This is code is experimental and intended for educational purposes only.
